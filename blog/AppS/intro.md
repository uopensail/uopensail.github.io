# Applicaton Store(AppS) Introduction

Apps functions as a digital distribution platform similar to Apple's AppStore or Google Play, focusing on providing users with a variety of applications and games. Our primary key performance indicator is the number of user downloads and installations, which directly reflects the platform's usage and user satisfaction.

**Current Status**

1. **Network Adaptability**  
   In situations of no network or weak network, this platform utilizes cached information to ensure that the user interface remains fully populated, avoiding blank screens. This feature enhances user experience under various network conditions.

2. **App and Game Distribution**  
   The platform primarily distributes apps and games. With the expertise of our operational staff, these are configured for placement on different leaderboards. However, as these leaderboards are manually operated, the configuration tasks are heavy, with the homepage alone featuring more than 20 leaderboards. This results in longer onboarding cycles, typically requiring two weeks for review. This manual configuration approach leads to slow leaderboard updates and poor performance of new apps during the cold start phase, reducing overall distribution efficiency.

3. **Performance of "Guess You Like" Section**  
   The "You May Like" section of the platform is a relatively high-traffic area, accounting for **45%** of the platform's daily active users, yet it only contributes **5%** of the total downloads. Despite the high traffic, the limited exposure slots result in download volumes not matching the expected contribution levels.

**Future Goals**

To enhance the number of downloads and installations, the platform plans to integrate an advanced recommendation system. Through intelligent recommendations, we aim to effectively expedite leaderboard updates and improve the exposure of new applications, thereby enhancing overall distribution efficiency and optimizing user experience.
